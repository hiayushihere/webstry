## Web Scraping Project
This repository contains a Python script for web scraping along with a Jupyter Notebook documenting the process and a CSV file to store the scraped data.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is purely educational and for learning purposes. Web scraping involves extracting data from websites, and while it can be a valuable tool for gathering information, it's important to use it responsibly and ethically. This project serves as an exploration into web scraping techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
## Disclaimer
It's important to note that web scraping can potentially violate the terms of service of websites and may be illegal in some cases. However, this project was undertaken solely for educational purposes to understand the concepts and techniques involved in web scraping. No data was scraped from websites that explicitly prohibit scraping, and the data collected is not intended for any commercial or malicious use.

## Usage
To run the web scraping script, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can execute the script in your preferred Python environment. The Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the scraping process and can be executed cell-by-cell to understand each step.
